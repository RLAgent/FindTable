			<h1>Find a Table project page</h1>
			<h2>Project description</h2>
			<p>
				It&rsquo;s 6:30 on Friday night, and you’re going out with a few friends, but most good restaurants are full. You can either call each restaurant
				and ask how long the wait list is, or you can pull out Find a Table. We give you real-time information about which restaurants near you have
				enough space to seat you or how long their wait lists are. Tap on a table to get detailed information about the restaurant
				(prices, menus, reviews, and contact information).
			</p><p>
				This app aggregates data (reported by the restaurants) on the current number of openings or length of the wait line into a centralised database,
				so that the user’s app can access the database and quickly see which restaurants are available for them at that moment.
			</p><p>
				We will create three apps: a desktop and a smartphone app for the customer, and a pure Android app for the restaurant. A customer inputs
				a city (or uses <span class="sc">GPS</span>) and his party size, and the app returns a list of available restaurants, displayed either as
				a sortable list, or else as pins on a map. The restaurant uses the simple and intuitive Restaurant App to update the number of open tables
				as they turn over. 
			</p>
			
			<h2>Projected timeline</h2>
			<table>
				<tr><th>21 March</th><td>
						Have a working basic prototype set up (a server, Restaurant app, and Customer app that are able to communicate with one another).
					</td>
				</tr><tr>
					<th>28 March</th>
					<td>
						Have all functionalities working for a presentable app (including the GUI, etc.), but with only all the major features
						(i.e., things like, e.g., restaurant menu item search aren’t needed at this point), although the more working at this point the better.
					</td>
				</tr><tr>
					<th>07 April</th>
					<td>
						Have the initial app thoroughly tested (e.g., through branch- and stress-testing) by this point, with all detected errors fixed.
					</td>
				</tr><tr>
					<th>11 April</th>
					<td>
						Have the fixed version re-tested by this point. Release alpha version to testers. Ask testers to actively give feedback and questions
						during this period.
					</td>
				</tr><tr>
					<th>25 April</th>
					<td>
						Implement changes from alpha test by this point. Also implement any additional features we wanted to add that we left out March 28
						by this point.
					</td>
				</tr><tr>
					<th>02 May</th>
					<td>
						Test the alpha changes thoroughly by this point. Release beta version.
					</td>
