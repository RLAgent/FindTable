It’s 6:30 on Friday night, and you’re going out with a few friends, but most 
good restaurants are full. You can either call each restaurant and ask how long 
the wait list is, or you can pull out FindTable. We give you real-time 
information about which restaurants near you have enough space to seat you or 
how long their wait lists are. Tap on a table to get detailed information 
about the restaurant (prices, menus, reviews, and contact information).

This app aggregates data (reported by the restaurants) on the current number of 
openings or length of the wait line into a centralised database, so that the 
user’s app can access the database and quickly see which restaurants are 
available for them at that moment.

There are three apps: a desktop and a smartphone app for the customer, and a 
pure Android app for the restaurant. A customer inputs a city (or uses GPS) 
and his party size, and the app returns a list of available restaurants, 
displayed either as a sortable list, or else as pins on a map. The restaurant 
uses the simple and intuitive Restaurant App to update the number of open 
tables as they turn over.
